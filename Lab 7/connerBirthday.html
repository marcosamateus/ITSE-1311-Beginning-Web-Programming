            Conner's birthday is on November 16th. This year that falls on a Monday. I typically wouldn't do anything for him, but this year everyone seems to want to. I am not sure yet what we are going to do, but I'm almost positive it's gonna be lame.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you'd like to go, that would be cool, but if you don't want to go, I totally understand that as well. It's probably not going to be that great to be completely honest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't mean to seem like I don't care about Conner's Birthday, but he lives with me, so I see him literally every day all the time. I think for his birthday maybe he should go out of town! That might be ideal for everyone involved!
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I'd like for Conner to have a good party, and I hope all of you will be there, but I probably will not go, as I think his birthday gift from me will be some time away from each other. Plus, I think he wants to do a private screening of Cat's the Musical, and I definitely do NOT want to see that!
